% Large Language Models (LLMs) have changed the way computers understand and use human language. They're used in many different areas, and in this talk we'll look at how people use and evaluate them. We'll start by looking at the different ways people use LLMs. First, when they are used as general assistants for tasks like writing, summarizing, coding, etc. Then, when they are adapted to address more domain-specific tasks using two approaches: 1) retrieval-assisted generation, and 2) fine-tuning. We'll also see how LLMs are integrated into software applications, such as when they are invoked by computer code (API calls) or used by autonomous agents to make decisions on their own. On the evaluation side, we'll talk about a method called MTBench, a multi-turn question set, and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform between LLMs.





\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}{Introduction}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Since the inception of Large Language Models, various patterns of use and evaluation of this technology have emerged.
\item In this talk, we will try to organize these patterns and give a general overview of them.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Recap: What is an LLM}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Large Language Model: An autoregressive language model trained with a Transformer neural network on a large corpus (hundreds of bullions of tokens) and a large parameter space (billions) to predict the next word.
\item It is usually later aligned to work as a user assistant using techniques such as Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback  \cite{ouyang2022training} or supervised fine-tuning.
\item Some are private (access via API or web browser): Google Bard, ChatGPT, etc.
\item Others are open (model's weights can be downloaded): Llama, LLama2, Falcon, etc.
\end{itemize}

 \begin{figure}[h]
        	\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{pics/gptllama.png}
        \end{figure}

\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Zero-shot, One-shot, and Few-shot Learning}
\scriptsize
The most remarkable feature of these models is their few-shot, one-shot, zero-shot learning capabilities (also known as ``in-context-learning'').
 \begin{figure}[h]
        	\includegraphics[scale = 0.12]{pics/zeroonefew.png}
        \end{figure}  

This means that they can learn new tasks without large amounts of human-annotated data.


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Talk Overview}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Despite the recency of this technology, its adoption has been tremendous in many areas. 
 \item Below, we propose a simple categorization of the ways in which LLMs are used and evaluated.
  \item These patterns will serve as the narrative backbone of this presentation.

\section{General-domain Assistant}

\begin{frame}{Usage Pattern 1: General-domain Assistant}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this pattern a user interacts with the LLM proving prompts as input and receiving a text as answer.
\item The knowledge the LLM has access is limited to the corpus on which it was trained and the context given in the prompt.
\end{itemize}

 \begin{figure}[h]

        \end{figure}  


\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Tasks}
\begin{scriptsize}
LLMs can solve many tasks with this pattern:

\begin{itemize}
\item Textual: Language understanding and common sense (e.g., rewriting, summarizing, translating, answering questions)
\item Arithmetic: Mathematical reasoning  (it can fail in many cases though)
\item Visual: Multimodal reasoning involving pictures (GPT-4, Llava)
\item Symbolic: Structured input such as programming languages
\end{itemize}

\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Prompt Engineering: Guiding the Language Model}
\begin{scriptsize}
Prompt engineering, often referred to as ``Prompting,'' is the discipline or ``art'' of crafting effective prompts to guide the Language Model (LM) towards generating accurate responses. Some common prompting guidelines: \vspace{0.5cm}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Clarity and Conciseness}: Clearly articulate the prompt to minimize ambiguity and ensure the LM understands the task at hand.
\item \textbf{Use of Specific Examples}: Provide concrete examples within the prompt to offer the LM context.
\item \textbf{Role-based Prompts}: incorporating roles into the prompts (e.g., a tour guide, a teacher, a doctor, a sales person).
\item \textbf{Desired Output Specification}: Clearly define the desired format of the output (e.g, JSON, HTML, csv, markdown, latex).
\end{itemize}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Chain-of-thought Prompting}

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Chain-of-thought prompting is a mechanism for eliciting multi-step reasoning behavior in large language models.
\item  This method involves augmenting each exemplar in a few-shot prompt with a connected sequence of thoughts, creating a structured chain of logical steps. \cite{wei2022chain}
\end{itemize}
\end{scriptsize}

\end{frame}


\section{Domain-specific Assistant}

\begin{frame}{Usage Pattern 2: Domain-specific Assistant}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Idea: Incorporate domain-specific knowledge not covered in training (e.g., recent news, private documents).
\item This is very common for companies developing chatbots with private documents or for creating more domain-specific chatbots.
\item There are two main patterns to achieve this:
\begin{enumerate}\scriptsize
 \item Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Vector Databases)
 \item Fine-Tuning
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}


\end{scriptsize}
% https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/common-use-cases
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Usage Pattern 2.1: Retrieval-Augmented Generation}
\begin{scriptsize}
Idea: Incorporate domain-specific knowledge into the query using information retrieval and document embeddings (i.e., densely encoded vectors that capture the semantic information of the document). \cite{lewis2021retrievalaugmented}.

\end{scriptsize}

    \begin{figure}[h]
        	\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{pics/retrievalaugmented.pdf}
        \end{figure}  


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Retrieval-Augmented Generation Process}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Encode all domain-specific documents using document embeddings and store them in a vector database.  
  \begin{itemize}\scriptsize
    \item OpenAI provides a vectorizer called (text2vec-openai), but there are many open source alternatives.
 \item There are also many vector databases available, a popular one is \textbf{weaviate}.
  \end{itemize}
 \item Encode the prompt with the same vectorizer used to encode documents.
 \item Use prompt embedding and the vector database to retrieve relevant documents based on similarity.
 \item Create a refined prompt that includes a domain-specific role, the user prompt, and the retrieved documents as contexts.
 \item Send the refined prompt to the LLM and return the response to the user.
\end{enumerate}

\end{scriptsize}

\begin{frame}{Usage Pattern 2.2: Fine-Tuning}
\begin{scriptsize}
Idea: Incorporate domain-specific knowledge by fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM with the next-token prediction task over a domain-specific corpus and interact with the resulting LLM. 



    \begin{figure}[h]
        	\includegraphics[scale = 0.35]{pics/llmfinetuning.pdf}

This can be computationally expensive unless some tricks are used.
\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Instruction Fine-tuning}

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item A more efficient way to fine-tune Large Language Models is Instruction Fine-Tuning  \cite{chung2022scaling}.
\item Idea: instead of fine-tuning the LLM with raw text with next token prediction, train it with pairs of prompts and user-aligned answers.
\item Collect examples of (instruction, output) pairs across many tasks and finetune an LM.
\item Evaluate on unseen tasks.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Considerations for Instruction Tuning}
\scriptsize


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Source:} How was the data obtained? Most datasets have been generated using ChatGPT. They may thus inherit biases of the source model or may be noisy.

    \item \textbf{Data Quality:} Was any filtering done to improve the quality of the generated data? In most cases, filtering is based on simple heuristics or a pre-trained model, which can result in noisy data.

    \item \textbf{Domain and Language Coverage:} Most datasets focus on general QA-style in English, but methods can be adapted for other domains or languages.

    \item \textbf{Number of Dialog Turns:} Single-turn datasets include a prompt and response. Consider multi-turn data for training a more conversational model.

    \item \textbf{License Terms:} Data from OpenAI models follows OpenAI terms, restricting use for competing models. Seek datasets with more permissive licenses to avoid legal complications.

%LoRA is an improved finetuning method where instead of finetuning all the weights that constitute the weight matrix of the pre-trained large language model, two smaller matrices that approximate this larger matrix are fine-tuned. These matrices constitute the LoRA adapter. This fine-tuned adapter is then loaded to the pretrained model and used for inference.

%QLoRA is an even more memory efficient version of LoRA where the pretrained model is loaded to GPU memory as quantized 4-bit weights (compared to 8-bits in the case of LoRA), while preserving similar effectiveness to LoRA. Probing this method, comparing the two methods when necessary, and figuring out the best combination of QLoRA hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance with the quickest training time will be the focus here.

\begin{frame}{Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Traditional model fine-tuning (i.e., adjusting all Transformer weights via backpropagation) is time and resource-intensive.
    \item Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) are a series of techniques to mitigate this problem.
    \item The most popular ones are LoRA (Low Rank Adaptation) \cite{hu2021lora} and QLoRA \cite{dettmers2023qlora}.
    \item These approaches achieve siginficant reduction in the number of trainable parameters allowing to perform fine-tuning with affordable hardware.
\end{itemize}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{LoRA}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item LoRa is based on the idea of adapters.
\item Instead of fine-tuning the whole network, we freeze it during the fine-tuning process and add a few parameters that are trained to adapt the original model to the new data.
          \end{itemize}

      \begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[scale = 0.35]{pics/lora.png}
\end{figure}

\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{LoRA}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
        \item Let $W_0 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$ be the weight matrix of the pre-trained network.
    \item LoRA uses two adjustable low-rank decomposition matrices of predefined rank $r$, \(B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}\) and \(A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}\).
    \item The resulting fine-tuned network $W_L$ is obtained as follows:
      \begin{equation}
    W_L = W_0 + \Delta W = W_0 + BA, \quad B \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}, \quad A \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times d}
  \end{equation}
 \item During training, \(W_0\) remains frozen, and only \(B\) and \(A\) receive gradient updates.
 \item The lower the value of $r$, the fewer parameters will be trained during fine-tuning (there is a trade-off between performance and computation costs).
      \end{itemize}

\end{scriptsize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{QLoRA}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item QLoRA is an even more memory efficient version of LoRA where the pretrained model is loaded to GPU memory as \textbf{quantized} 4-bit weights.
\item QLoRA dequantizes weights from the storage data type to the computation data type to perform the forward and backward passes.
\item It only computes weight gradients for the LoRA parameters which use 16-bit bfloat.
\item QLORA reduces the average memory requirements of finetuning a 65B parameter model from $>780GB$ of GPU memory to $<48GB$.
\end{itemize}
\end{scriptsize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Quantization}
\scriptsize
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Quantization: Process of discretizing input from high-bit representation to low-bit representation.
      \item To ensure that the entire range of the low-bit data type is used, the input data type is commonly rescaled into the target data type range through normalization by the absolute maximum of the input elements.
        \item Example: quantizing a 32-bit Floating Point (FP32) tensor into a Int8 tensor with range $[-127, 127]$:
        \[X_{\text{Int8}} = \text{round}_{\text{digits}(0)}\left(\frac{127}{\text{absmax}(X_{\text{FP32}})} \cdot X_{\text{FP32}}\right) = \text{round}_{\text{digits}(0)}\left(c_{\text{FP32}} \cdot X_{\text{FP32}}\right)\]
        where $c$ is the quantization constant or quantization scale.
        \item Dequantization:
    \[\text{dequant}(c_{\text{FP32}}, X_{\text{Int8}}) = \frac{X_{\text{Int8}}}{ c_{\text{FP32}}} = X_{\text{FP32}}\]
    \end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{QLoRA main Ideas}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item  4-bit NormalFloat, an information theoretically optimal quantization data type for normally distributed data\footnote{pretrained neural network weights usually have a zero-centered normal distribution with standard deviation $\sigma$}  that yields better empirical results than 4-bit Integers and 4-bit Floats.
\item Double Quantization, a method that quantizes the quantization constants, saving an average of about 0.37 bits per parameter (approximately 3 GB for a 65B model).
\item Paged Optimizers, using NVIDIA unified memory to avoid the gradient checkpointing memory spikes that occur when processing a mini-batch with a long sequence length.
\end{itemize}
\end{scriptsize}

\end{frame}



\section{Applications}

\begin{frame}{Usage Pattern 3: Applications}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item LLMs are widely embedded in software through API calls.
\item Why? Because LLM's apart from generating text cannot perform other type of actions.
\item Example: search engines (\url{you.com}), Bing chat.
\item For example, PDF summarization software. You write software that first converts the PDF to raw text and then sends it to an LLM for summarization.
\item Or software for summarizing video conferences. First the audio is transcribed and then summarized with an LLM.
\item From a software point of view, this isn't much different from any software that interacts with an external API.
\item ChatGPT Plugins: \url{https://gptstore.ai/}

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Autonomous agents lie at the heart of classical AI.
\item Agents are programs that interact autonomously with an environment and perform actions to achieve specific goals.
\item The ReaAct (Reasoning and Acting) pattern \cite{yao2022react} is a framework is which LLMs are used to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner for agents.


\item Agents are a special kind of LLMs application in which the LLM serves as the reasoning and planning component of the software.

\item LangChain is a very popular python Library for implementing LLM-based agents.

\begin{frame}{General setup of an agent}
\scriptsize
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Consider a general setup of an agent interacting with an environment to solve a task.
        \item There are several discrete time steps $t_0,t_1,\dots,t_n$.
        \item There is a set of all possible states or observations $O$ received from the environment.
        \item There is a set of actions $A$ that the agent can take.    
        \item At each time step $t$, the agent receives an observation $o_t \in O$ and  takes the action $a_t \in A$ following a policy $\pi(a_t | c_t)$ where context $c_t = (o_1, a_1, \ldots, o_{t-1}, a_{t-1}, o_t)$.
        \item Learning a policy is challenging when the mapping  $c_t \mapsto a_t$ is highly implicit and requires extensive computation.

\begin{frame}{ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning + Acting}
\scriptsize
    \begin{itemize}
\item In the ReAct framework, we expand the agent's action space by incorporating a Language Model (LLM), denoted as $A' = A \cup L$ (with $L$ representing the language space).

\item The environment is conceptualized as a toolkit, consisting of diverse interfaces that the agent can leverage.

 \item These interfaces take various forms, including API calls and Python functions (such as a search engine, calculator, or web scraper).

 \item At each step, the agent consults the LLM (using chain of thought prompting) to determine its next action, considering the available tools. 

 
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning + Acting}
\scriptsize
    \begin{itemize}

\item This action, denoted as $a'_t \in L$ within the language space, is termed a ``thought''.

\item The context is dynamically updated as $c_{t+1} = (c_t, a'_t)$ for subsequent reasoning or action.

\item The agent then executes one of the available tools to perform the action, incorporating the result as a new observation in the next prompt sent to the model.

\item This iterative process continues until the task is successfully solved.     

\item Problem: if the model starts to hallucinate or to repeat itself, we can easily follow a trajectory of actions that takes us nowhere or end up in a loop.

%MT-bench is a series of open-ended questions that evaluate a chatbotâs multi-turn conversational and instruction-following ability â two critical elements for human preference. MT-bench is also carefully constructed to differentiate chatbots based on their core capabilities, such as reasoning and math. In addition, we develop Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced platform featuring anonymous battles between chatbots in real-world scenarios â Users engage in conversations with two chatbots at the same time and rate their responses based on personal preferences.


%Meta-Evaluation. To effectively assess the quality of LLM-based evaluators, meta-evaluation benchmarks have been introduced, for gauging the agreement with human  preferences and the fairness of the evaluations made by LLMs [647, 727, 893, 897, 898]. As a representative benchmark, MT-Bench [727] evaluates the agreement between LLMs and human judgments, demonstrating that GPT-4 aligns closely with human preferences in no-tie compar-isons on 80 multi-turn questions.

\begin{itemize}
\item How standard mono-task NLP systems are usually evaluated?
\item There is a gold-standard evaluation dataset not used during training on which predictions can be compared against gold labels using tasks-specific metrics (e.g., F1, BLEU).
\item LLMS are intrinsically multi-task and open-ended.
\item Hence, cannot easily be evaluated with this approach.
\item Another caveat is that aligned LLM

\begin{frame}[t]
  \frametitle{Overview of Base LLM Evaluation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Typical benchmarks for base LLMs involve close-ended problems, such as multiple-choice questions.
    \item Two main categories: knowledge-oriented and reasoning-oriented benchmarks.
    \item Recent benchmarks (e.g., OpenCompass) combine both types for comprehensive evaluation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]
  \frametitle{Knowledge-Oriented Benchmarks}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Examples: MMLU [364] and C-Eval [711].
    \item Evaluate the capacity of world knowledge.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
  \frametitle{Reasoning-Oriented Benchmarks}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Examples: GSM8K [643], BBH [365], and MATH [364].
    \item Focus on evaluating the capability of solving complex reasoning tasks.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
  \frametitle{Combined Benchmarks}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Example: OpenCompass [713].
    \item Comprehensive comparison by combining both knowledge-oriented and reasoning-oriented aspects.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]
  \frametitle{Benchmark-Based Evaluation Procedure}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Format each problem into a prompt for LLMs to generate the result text.
    \item Parse the generated result text using human-written rules to obtain the predicted answer.
    \item Calculate LLMs' performance automatically using standard metrics like accuracy by comparing with the ground-truth answer.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
  \frametitle{Few-Shot or Zero-Shot Setting}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluation can be conducted in either the few-shot or zero-shot setting.
    \item Few-shot setting is often more suitable for base LLMs due to their weak task generalization ability.
    \item CoT prompts might be necessary for complex reasoning tasks to fully exhibit capacity during evaluation.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
  \frametitle{Application to Fine-Tuned LLMs}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This evaluation approach can be applied to assess the abilities of fine-tuned LLMs.
    \item Leaderboards (e.g., Open LLM Leaderboard [707]) use this approach to evaluate both base and fine-tuned LLMs.
  \end{itemize}
